# Rohitha Portfolio Skeleton

This repository contains a starter Next.js project for building the portfolio site originally designed in Canva.

## Project Plan

* **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) with the App Router and TypeScript.
* **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for rapid styling.
* **Pages**:
  - `/` – Home / Hero section
  - `/about` – About me information
  - `/projects` – Portfolio projects gallery
  - `/contact` – Contact details or form
* **Components**:
  - `Navbar` for site navigation
  - `Footer` for basic footer content
* **Future Work**: The design and content from Canva will be translated into React components and pages within this structure.
